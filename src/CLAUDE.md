# Claude Memory File

## Working Guidelines
never unstage or undo my changes (unless explicitly asked), understand and incorporate them!

This project contains the source code for the go language and it's compiler and its toolchains.
It is very comprehensive and we need to be careful when searching for a code to not use up all our clout code subscription context window and usage.

Do NOT explore the whole codebase structure and architecture

We are trying to achieve small modifications to the compiler only and nothing else thus we only want to recompile the compiler and not the whole toolchain.

Always start simple and when the simple case works add more complexity. 

!!! Important! Never do destructive commands like remove, rm, git clean, etc without explicit user confirmation, even in YOLO mode!!!

### Style Guidelines

Always replace interface{} with any 


# Compile
To compile go, use the following command:

cd /opt/other/go/src
./make.bash 2>&1 | tail -10

# Go Compiler Lexer/Scanner Summary

## Main Files:
Project root folder `/opt/other/go/`
Claude root folder `/opt/other/go/src/`
Core lexical analysis for Go compiler
Main files:
`cmd/compile/internal/syntax/scanner.go`: main scanner implementation
`go/scanner/scanner.go`: standard scanner used by tools like `go run`, `go build`
`go/scanner/tokens.go`: token definitions
`go/scanner/source.go`: source reading and buffering
./cmd/compile/internal/noder folder with important files:
 unified.go lex_test.go lex.go import.go posmap.go types.go export.go quirks.go codes.go writer.go linker.go doc.go reader.go irgen.go helpers.go noder.go Token types defined in `tokens.go`, scanner state in scanner struct
Character reading via `source.go` buffered reader
Supports UTF-8, tracks line/column positions
`next()` method: main tokenization loop with large switch statement for each character

### Dual Scanner System
  1. Standard Scanner (go/scanner/scanner.go) Used by go run, go build, and other tools for initial parsing/package analysis
  2. Internal Syntax Scanner (cmd/compile/internal/syntax/scanner.go) Used by the compiler itself for actual compilation
Two main scanning modes: normal tokens + comment/directive callbacks

## Key Methods:
`next()`: main tokenization (big switch ~line 110-355)
`ident()`: identifier scanning
`number()`: numeric literal parsing  
`stdString()`, `rawString()`, `rune()`: string/char literals
`lineComment()`, `fullComment()`: comment handling
Error handling via `errorf()`, position tracking


## Implementation Order for builtins
1. types2 declarations (universe.go)
2. types2 handling (builtins.go)
3. IR declarations (node.go)
4. IR registration (typecheck/universe.go)
5. IR handling (func.go, typecheck.go)
Files:
src/go/types/call.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/ir/node.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/typecheck/func.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/typecheck/typecheck.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/typecheck/universe.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/types2/builtins.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/types2/call.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/types2/universe.go
src/cmd/compile/internal/types2/typexpr.go

## Generated Files (DO NOT EDIT)
Never touched generated files such as
src/cmd/compile/internal/ir/op_string.go
  *_string.go Generated by stringer tool for enum/const string representations, e.g. token_string.go
  *_gen.go Generated by various code generators
  builtin.go Generated by mkbuiltin.go for runtime function signatures
  rewrite*.go Generated SSA rewrite rules
  token_string.go Generated token name strings
  Files with headers like // Code generated by ... DO NOT EDIT.

Rule: If you see DO NOT EDIT in the header, never modify it directly. Find the source file/generator that creates it and modify that instead. And generate via ./make.bash

# Testing Guidelines
recompile bin/go before testing!
Always create exactly one new go file <git_root>/goo/test_{feature}.go to test the new feature; not src/goo, rather ../goo/ ! Don't try to create a new folder. If the folder does not exist you're trying the wrong folder: it should exist!)
Only create ONE new test per feature and reuse existing tests for very similar features.
Before committing quickly run these new tests with the freshly built ../bin/go 
After committing, run the following command in src/ to test the compatibility with the whole system:

Currently ignore the system test because it fails unrelated to our changes:
```bash
GOROOT=/opt/other/go ./run.bash --no-rebuild 2>&1 | grep -Ev '^\?|^ok ' | grep -m1 FAIL && exit 1
```
This command runs the tests, filters out the output to show only failures, and exits with an error code if any tests fail.
if we encounter a FAIL, ponder whether our changes might be related to it and if so try once to fix it or tell me to look at it.

# Test Writing Memories
Usually when you create one test there's no more need to modify it unless you really missed something
USE existing tests instead of writing new ones
## Editing Guidelines
never edit token_string.go
always use ../bin/go 
NEVER manually touch generated files like op_string.go  token_string.go 

tools requires Go 1.25, but system go is 1.24.5 => 
there is an option to ignore the go.mod OR  
use bin/go instead of global go!

## Enum Stability Practices
 - Never insert in middle of enums
 - Always append new operations at end
 - Use external bootstrap for enum changes
 - Add validation tests for critical constants
 - 
To avoid code duplication do a quick git history search (grep?) to see if there have been related changes

I don't understand why it's so hard to just 
Rewrite printf as fmt.Println in the AST (via keyword/token/builtin??)
You should just forward everything via the compiler to fmt.Println, not through the runtime!
so treat it very differently(!) than the other builtins print, println 
Do NOT treat it as case ir.OPRINT, ir.OPRINTLN
Do NOT forward to builtin println, forward to fmt.Println instead!!!
For this to work you need to automatically import fmt in the file where you use printf.                          â”‚
But let's skip this for later and always include fmt (might break the compiler boot-strapping?)

### current todo:
/opt/other/go/src/cmd/compile/internal/typecheck/func.go

### Test printf :
cd /opt/other/go/src/
GOROOT=/opt/other/go ../bin/go ../goo/test_printf.go
GOROOT=/opt/other/go ../bin/go ../goo/test_printf_fmt.go
Do not modify the test do not create new tests for now 


may conflict with package printf!
"For details of a specific checker such as 'printf', see 'go tool vet help printf'."
