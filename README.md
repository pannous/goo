# The Goo Programming Language  
  
Goo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.  
  
Goo is an up-to-date fork of Go with the following modifications:  
<!--  
just like most ugliness in the world appears when you add a five to json(5)   
so does adding a little o to Go[o] make everything a little more beautiful  
-->  
‚úÖ truthy/falsey if    
‚úÖ # comment and shebang support    
‚úÖ goo file extension    
‚úÖ √∏ / ‚â† / ¬¨ / not operator keyword for `nil` `!`    
‚úÖ and or operators for && ||  
‚úÖ no Main needed ‚òê  implicit package main    
‚úÖ printf as synonym for fmt.Println  with fmt as auto-import (similar to OPRINTLN|OPRINT?)  
‚úÖ typeof(x)  compile-time or runtime reflect.TypeOf(x).String()?  
‚úÖ check 1>2 // check keyword: if not truthy($condition) { panic($condition.text) } else { println("check OK", $condition.text) }  
‚úÖ z := [1,2,3]  // []any{1,2,3} or []int{1,2,3}  
‚úÖ z := ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; z#1 == 'a'  // 1-indexed array access using # operator  
‚úÖ Get rid of generated cancer files like op_string.go  token_string.go by stringer cancer ü§Æü¶Äü§Æ  
‚úÖ go command default to run => `go test.go` OK
‚úÖ def as synonym for func, e.g. def main() { ... }  
‚úÖ allow unused imports: as warning!  
‚úÖ z := map{"a": 1, "b": 2}  => map[any]any{‚Ä¶}  
‚úÖ z := {a: 1, b: 2}  // symbol keys to strings => z := {"a": 1, "b": 2}  
‚úÖ map[active:true age:30 name:Alice]   
‚úÖ test_list_comparison.goo [1,2]==[1,2]  
‚úÖ x:={a:1,b:2}; put(x) => fmt.Printf("%v\n",x)
‚úÖ enum Status { OK, BAD } with generated .String() method 

‚òê import "helper.go"
‚òê runtime disable gc for extreme (resume?) performance, e.g. via `go run -gc=off test.go`
‚òê GPU Intrinsics: forward []int{} vectors to GPU (simple primitive SIMD/CUDA/Metal/OpenCL adapters)
‚òê optional braces for function calls put 42 => put(42)   HARD?
‚òê optional chaining via ?. operator, e.g. x?.y?.z => if not err{y.z}?
‚òê check keyword works great, now let it emit debug message, e.g.  check 1>0  "check OK 1>0" via builtin println   
‚òê map can only be compared to nil {a: 1, b: 2} == {b: 2, a: 1} HARD  
‚òê for loops  :    
‚òê for keyword := keywords  => for _, keyword := range keywords { __
‚òê String methods "abc".contains("a")  1. real 2. by compiler 
‚òê return void, e.g. return print("ok") HARD    
‚òê void(!) as synonym for func, e.g. void main(){} BAD  
‚òê public() -> Public() calls OK // as compiler plugin?  
    Rust allows snake_case to call CamelCase methods via compiler desugaring, but warns.  
    Automatically detect if there is an uppercased public function available, if there is no private function with lowercase name.  
‚òê silent/implicit error propagation  
‚òê a is Type for type assertion, e.g. if a is int {} => if _, ok := a.(int); ok { ... }
‚òê func test() int { 42 } => func test() int { return 42 }  auto return 
‚òê func test(){ 42 } => func test() int { return 42 }  auto return (+ type inference)
‚òê class via struct (!)    
‚òê plugin.Open() is for loading .so files at runtime
‚òê imported and not used only warning   
‚òê cross off all done tasks from this list    
‚òê any other pain points you and I might have     
êÑÇ AAA Game Engine Core? Never

### Download and Install  
  
#### Binary Distributions  
  
Official binary distributions are available at https://github.com/pannous/goo/releases.  
  
Download the archive file appropriate for your installation and operating system. Extract it to `/usr/local` (you may need to run the command as root or through sudo):  
  
```  
tar -C /usr/local -xzf goo1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz  
```  
  
Add `/usr/local/goo/bin` to your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your `$HOME/.profile` or `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation):  
  
```  
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/goo/bin  
export GOROOT=/usr/local/goo/  
```  
  
#### Install From Source  
  
```  
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pannous/goo  
cd goo/src  
./make.bash  
```
