# The Goo Programming Language

Goo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Goo is an up-to-date fork of Go with the following modifications:
<!--
just like most ugliness in the world appears when you add a five to json(5) 
so does adding a little o to Go[o] make everything a little more beautiful
-->
‚úÖ truthy/falsey if  
‚úÖ # comment and shebang support  
‚úÖ goo file extension  
‚úÖ and or operators for && ||
‚úÖ ¬¨ / not operator keyword for `!`  
‚úÖ ‚â† operator for `!=`  
‚úÖ √∏ keyword for `nil`
‚úÖ no Main needed ‚òê  implicit package main  
‚úÖ printf as synonym for fmt.Println  with fmt as auto-import (similar to OPRINTLN|OPRINT?)
‚úÖ typeof(x)  compile-time or runtime reflect.TypeOf(x).String()?
‚úÖ check 1>2 // check keyword: if not truthy($condition) { panic($condition.text) } 
‚úÖ z := map{"a": 1, "b": 2}  => map[any]any{‚Ä¶}
‚úÖ z := {a: 1, b: 2}  // symbol keys to strings => z := {"a": 1, "b": 2}
‚úÖ z := [1,2,3]  // []any{1,2,3} or []int{1,2,3}
‚úÖ z := ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; z#1 == 'a'  // 1-indexed array access using # operator
‚úÖ Get rid of generated cancer files like op_string.go  token_string.go by stringer cancer ü§Æü¶Äü§Æ
‚òê go command should default to run, so go test.go should work  
‚òê for keyword := keywords  => for _, keyword := range keywords {
‚òê String methods "abc".contains("a")
‚òê return void, e.g. return print("ok")  
‚òê def as synonym for func, e.g. def main() { ... }  
‚òê void(!) as synonym for func, e.g. void main(){}
‚òê public() -> Public() calls OK // as compiler plugin?
    Rust allows snake_case to call CamelCase methods via compiler desugaring, but warns.
    Automatically detect if there is an uppercased public function available, if there is no private function with lowercase name.
‚òê silent/implicit error propagation
‚òê for loops    
‚òê enums via struct or const ( ILLEGAL Token = iota
‚òê class via struct  
‚òê imported and not used only warning 
‚òê cross off all done tasks from this list  
‚òê any other pain points you and I might have   
‚òê map can only be compared to nil
