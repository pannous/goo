# The Goo Programming Language  
  
Goo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.  
  
Goo is an up-to-date fork of Go with the following modifications:  
<!--  
just like most ugliness in the world appears when you add a five to json(5)   
so does adding a little o to Go[o] make everything a little more beautiful  
-->  
‚úÖ truthy/falsey if    
‚úÖ # comment and shebang support    
‚úÖ goo file extension    
‚úÖ √∏ / ‚â† / ¬¨ / not operator keyword for `nil` `!`    
‚úÖ and or operators for && ||  
‚úÖ no Main needed ‚òê  implicit package main    
‚úÖ printf as synonym for fmt.Println  with fmt as auto-import (similar to OPRINTLN|OPRINT?)  
‚úÖ typeof(x)  compile-time or runtime reflect.TypeOf(x).String()?  
‚úÖ check 1>2 // check keyword: if not truthy($condition) { panic($condition.text) } else { println("check OK", $condition.text) }  
‚úÖ z := [1,2,3]  // []any{1,2,3} or []int{1,2,3}  
‚úÖ z := ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; z#1 == 'a'  // 1-indexed array access using # operator  
‚úÖ Get rid of generated cancer files like op_string.go  token_string.go by stringer cancer ü§Æü¶Äü§Æ  
‚úÖ go command default to run => `go test.go` OK
‚úÖ def as synonym for func, e.g. def main() { ... }  
‚úÖ allow unused imports: as warning!  
‚úÖ z := map{"a": 1, "b": 2}  => map[any]any{‚Ä¶}  
‚úÖ z := {a: 1, b: 2}  // symbol keys to strings => z := {"a": 1, "b": 2}  
‚úÖ map[active:true age:30 name:Alice]   
‚úÖ test_list_comparison.goo [1,2]==[1,2]  
‚òê map can only be compared to nil {a: 1, b: 2} == {b: 2, a: 1} HARD  
‚òê check keyword works great, now let it emit debug message, e.g.  check 1>0  "check OK 1>0" via builtin println   
‚òê for loops  :    
‚òê for keyword := keywords  => for _, keyword := range keywords { __
‚òê printf(i)	=> printf("%v", i) for non-string types i

‚òê String methods "abc".contains("a")  
‚òê return void, e.g. return print("ok") HARD    
‚òê void(!) as synonym for func, e.g. void main(){} BAD  
‚òê public() -> Public() calls OK // as compiler plugin?  
    Rust allows snake_case to call CamelCase methods via compiler desugaring, but warns.  
    Automatically detect if there is an uppercased public function available, if there is no private function with lowercase name.  
‚òê silent/implicit error propagation  
‚òê enums via struct or const ( ILLEGAL Token = iota  
‚òê class via struct    
‚òê imported and not used only warning   
‚òê cross off all done tasks from this list    
‚òê any other pain points you and I might have     
  
x := 1
y := "test"
myString := fmt.Sprint("The value of x is ", x, " and the value of y is ", y)
myAutoConcat := "The value of x is " x " and the value of y is " y
myTemplate := `The value of x is ${x} and the value of y is ${y}!`

tar -C /usr/local -xzf goo1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz  
```  
  
Add `/usr/local/goo/bin` to your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your `$HOME/.profile` or `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation):  
  
```  
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/goo/bin  
```  
  
#### Install From Source  
  
```  
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pannous/goo  
cd goo/src  
./make.bash  
```
