# The Goo Programming Language

Goo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Goo is an up-to-date fork of Go with the following modifications:

üóπ truthy/falsey if  
üóπ # comment and shebang support  
üóπ goo file extension  
üóπ and or operators for && ||
üóπ ¬¨ / not operator keyword for `!`  
üóπ ‚â† operator for `!=`  
üóπ √∏ keyword for `nil`
üóπ no Main needed ‚òê  implicit package main  
üóπ printf as synonym for fmt.Println  with fmt as auto-import (similar to OPRINTLN|OPRINT?)
üóπ typeof(x)  compile-time or runtime reflect.TypeOf(x).String()?
üóπ check 1>2 // check keyword: if not truthy($condition) { panic($condition.text) } 
üóπ z := map{"a": 1, "b": 2}  => map[any]any{‚Ä¶}
üóπ z := {a: 1, b: 2}  // symbol keys to strings => z := {"a": 1, "b": 2}
üóπ z := [1,2,3]  // []any{1,2,3} or []int{1,2,3}
üóπ z := ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; z#1 == 'a'  // 1-indexed array access using # operator

‚òê for keyword := keywords  => for _, keyword := range keywords {
‚òê String methods "abc".contains("a")
‚òê return void, e.g. return print("ok")  
‚òê go command should default to run, so go test.go should work  
‚òê def as synonym for func, e.g. def main() { ... }  
‚òê void(!) as synonym for func, e.g. void main(){}
‚òê public() -> Public() calls OK // as compiler plugin?
    Rust allows snake_case to call CamelCase methods via compiler desugaring, but warns.
    Automatically detect if there is an uppercased public function available, if there is no private function with lowercase name.
‚òê silent/implicit error propagation
‚òê for loops    
‚òê enums via struct or const ( ILLEGAL Token = iota
‚òê class via struct  
‚òê imported and not used only warning 
‚òê cross off all done tasks from this list  
‚òê any other pain points you and I might have   
‚òê map can only be compared to nil

## New Features

### 1-Indexed Array Access (`#` operator)

Goo supports 1-indexed array access using the `#` operator as an alternative to traditional 0-indexed bracket notation:

```go
z := []rune{'a', 'b', 'c'}
first := z#1   // Gets 'a' (first element)
second := z#2  // Gets 'b' (second element) 
third := z#3   // Gets 'c' (third element)

// Works with any expression as index
idx := 2
char := z#idx  // Gets 'b'
char := z#(1+1) // Gets 'b'

// Correct precedence with operators
check z#1 == 'a'        // Parses as (z#1) == 'a'
result := z#1 + 5       // Works with arithmetic
valid := z#1 < 'z'      // Works with comparisons
```

**Implementation:** The `#` operator is converted at parse time to `[index-1]`, so `z#1` becomes `z[0]`, maintaining full compatibility with Go's type system and performance characteristics.

**Context-sensitive parsing:** The `#` character is treated as:
- **1-indexed operator** when following an identifier/expression: `z#1`
- **Comment start** when at beginning of line: `# This is a comment`

### Download and Install

#### Binary Distributions

Official binary distributions are available at https://github.com/pannous/goo/releases.

Download the archive file appropriate for your installation and operating system. Extract it to `/usr/local` (you may need to run the command as root or through sudo):

```
tar -C /usr/local -xzf goo1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Add `/usr/local/goo/bin` to your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your `$HOME/.profile` or `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation):

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/goo/bin
```

#### Install From Source

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pannous/goo
cd goo/src
./make.bash
```
